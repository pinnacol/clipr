There should be regexps that can identify how CLIPS will interpret a given string.

  /[+-]?\d+/  Integer
  /\w+/       Symbol

Etc.  The rules for Symbols are given in the bpg p7/33:

bq. A symbol in CLIPS is any sequence of characters that starts with any printable ASCII character and is followed by zero or more printable ASCII characters. When a delimiter is found, the symbol is ended. The following characters act as delimiters: any non-printable ASCII character (including spaces, tabs, carriage returns, and line feeds), a double quote, opening and closing parentheses “(” and “)”, an ampersand “&”, a vertical bar “|”, a less than “<”, and a tilde “~”. A semicolon “;” starts a CLIPS comment (see section 2.3.3) and also acts as a delimiter.
