title: Closing an env
type: issue
--- 
Environments are not supposed to be destroyed when running (see DestroyEnvironment).  This means they need to be stopped before close.

There appears to be no stop method.  A rule with priority can be added such that if you assert a stop fact, then the rhs of the rule calls halt.  Halt is supposed to stop any more rules from being evaluated.
