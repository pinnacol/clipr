title: Caching on env classes
type: issue
--- 
The routers class caches information that is in CLIPS; currently the Globals class does not.  As a result Globals#list is super wasteful but more definitively up-to-date than Routers.

Probably best to implement caching because under normal circumstances the cache will be up-to-date (ie users will go 100% through the API and the API won't produce side-effects).  An update method will have to be added to ensure out-of-date caches can be refreshed.
