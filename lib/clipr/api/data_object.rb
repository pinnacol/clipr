      # By default value will duplicate SYMBOL and STRING outputs.  This
      # behavior can be turned off by specifying dup = false, but be mindful
      # of the consequences, as discussed in the apg:
      #
      #   Do not store the pointer returned by DOToString or DOPToString as part
      #   of a permanent data structure. When CLIPS performs garbage collection
      #   on symbols and strings, the pointer reference to the string may be
      #   rendered invalid. To store a permanent reference to a string, allocate
      #   storage for a copy of the string and then copy the string returned by
      #   DOToString or DOPToString to the copyâ€™s storage area.
      #
