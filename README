= Clips

{CLIPS}[http://clipsrules.sourceforge.net/] bindings for Ruby.

== Description

The Clips gem provides {FFI}[http://github.com/ffi/ffi] bindings to the
embedded CLIPS API, and a set of classes which act as wrappers for the various
CLIPS constructs. Clips allows callbacks to Ruby from CLIPS so that procedural
logic and rules logic may be kept separate.

==== Notes

{CLIPS}[http://clipsrules.sourceforge.net/] (C Language Integrated Production
System) is an open-source expert system widely used throughout the government,
industry, and academia. CLIPS is powerful and fast, but requires some study
because it uses a programming style that many people will find unusual.

Users are encouraged to consult the {extensive and accessible CLIPS
documentation}[http://clipsrules.sourceforge.net/OnlineDocs.html] for
clarification of what the Clipr constructs are intended to do, as well as a
great deal more information regarding the CLIPS API.

== Usage

=== Clips::Api

The Api is organized into modules as described in the Advanced Programming
Guide (apg.pdf). All of the methods bind the contextual, environment-aware
forms of the API methods when possible.

  require 'clips/api'
  include Clips::Api
  
  # create an environment
  env_ptr = Environment::CreateEnvironment()
  
  # make the function call "(> 1 2)"
  obj = DataObject.new
  Environment::EnvFunctionCall(env_ptr, ">", "1 2", obj)
  
  # get the result out of the DataObject
  node = Struct::SymbolHashNode.new(obj[:value])
  node[:contents]          # => "FALSE"
  
  # cleanup the environment
  Environment::DestroyEnvironment(env_ptr)
  
Direct usage of the Api requires knowledge of the CLIPS API and an attention
to detail. The rest of Clips provides a wrapper to make the Api more
accessible.

  require 'clips'
  Clips::Env.open do |env|
    env.call(">", "1 2").value   # => false
  end

=== Clips

Clips is built around the Env class which represents a CLIPS environment.
Basic usage is similar to the console:

  env = Clips::Env.new
  facts = env.facts
  
  env.assert "(animal-is duck)"
  env.build  "(defrule duck (animal-is duck) => (assert (sound-is quack)))"
  
  facts.list  # => ["(initial-fact)", "(animal-is duck)"]
  
  env.run
  facts.list  # => ["(initial-fact)", "(animal-is duck)", "(sound-is quack)"]
  
  env.clear
  facts.list  # => ["(initial-fact)"]

More complex constructs can be defined in Ruby:

  class Animal < Clips::Deftemplate
    deftemplate "animal"
    slot :sound
  end
  Animal.str  # => "(deftemplate animal (slot sound))"

  class Quack < Clips::Defrule
    defrule "quack"
    lhs.match "animal", :sound => :quack
    rhs.assert "(sound-was quack)"
  end
  Quack.str   # => "(defrule quack (animal (sound quack)) => (assert (sound-was quack))"
  
  env.clear
  env.build(Animal)
  env.build(Quack)
  
  facts.assert(:animal, {:sound => :quack})
  env.run
  facts.list  # => ["(initial-fact)", "(animal (sound quack))", "(sound-was quack)"]

Clips provides a callback system that lets CLIPS use blocks written in Ruby.
This is a way of writing an equivalent quack rule (albeit with a very
different CLIPS construct):

  class QuackCall < Clips::Defrule
    lhs.match "animal", :sound do |sound|
      sound == :quack
    end
    
    rhs.call do |env|
      env.assert "(sound-was quack)"
    end
  end
  QuackCall.str  # => "(defrule quack_call (animal (sound ?sound)) (test (ruby-call ... ?sound)) => (ruby-call ...))"

  env.clear
  env.build(Animal)
  env.build(QuackCall)
  
  facts.assert(:animal, {:sound => :quack})
  env.run
  facts.list     # => ["(initial-fact)", "(animal (sound quack))", "(sound-was quack)"]

Deftemplates and Defrules are flexible enough to represent almost all CLIPS
constructs. See the documentation for examples of slot defaults, assignment,
retraction, or/and/not conditionals, and more!
