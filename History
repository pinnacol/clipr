Updated ffi to the unreleased 0.6.0, but note that this actually breaks the
code due to a compile-flag bug (http://github.com/ffi/ffi/issues/#issue/26).
This was fixed against 610fedd9de7a748221f43a6e94485c23a29f5dff as described
in the issue and packaged locally ffi-0.6.1. The working version is not
publicly available.

To package:

  % git checkout git://github.com/ffi/ffi.git
  % cd ffi
  % git checkout 610fedd9de7a748221f43a6e94485c23a29f5dff

Then add '-DHAVE_RAW_API' as in the issue, and bump the gem version in
Rakefile to '0.6.1'.  Then:

  % rake gem

And copy 'pkg/ffi-0.6.1' into the vendor/gems/cache directory. Then, in the
clipr directory run:

  % gem bundle
  % rake test

== 0.2.0 2009-12-22

Initial release.
